In this fork I used Tensorflow with [Universal Sentence Encoder](https://tfhub.dev/google/universal-sentence-encoder/4) to generate text embeddings from the CVE descriptions. I also added a script that uses Elasticsearch's [cosine similarity](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/7.6/query-dsl-script-score-query.html#vector-functions) function to find CVEs that are semantically related to a given description.

# cve-analysis
Tools for conducting analysis of CVE data in Elasticsearch

## Quckstart:
Download Elasticsearch and Kibana from elastic.co
You will need verison 7 or above

Start them (basically ./bin/elasticsearch and ./bin/kibana from the
respective directories).

Run `get-cve-json.sh` to download the CVE data from NVD  
Run `update-es.sh` to import the CVE data into Elasticsearch

You rerun the above commands to update your data whenever needed.

Now navigate your web browser to http://localhost:5601

Now go to the Management area. Click "Saved Objects". In the upper right of the
screen you'll see "Import". Import the cve-kibana.ndjson file.

Now you should have some basic visualizations and a dashboard to look at.
Happy hunting.
